# UNDER CONSTRUCTION (Research Project) 

## Current progress

### DDPG and PPO work very nicely

1500 Episodes for full cycling of goals

## Next steps:

This package is more or less done,

Multi-Robot (Will be in different Repo, probably called multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-active-slam)

## Bonus steps:

Explore CNN with 2D slam map (potentially use local + global feature maps suggested by Erik)
